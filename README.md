## ðŸ“š Learning Points 

Here are some key learning points from this project:

- :art: **CSS Grid:** The project utilizes CSS Grid to create responsive and flexible layouts.

- :lipstick: **Styling Tables:** The clone involves styling tables to create a visually appealing design.

- :sparkles: **Tabs with JavaScript:** The project implements switchable tabs using Vanilla JavaScript. The JavaScript code provided above demonstrates a simple way to achieve this functionality without relying on CSS frameworks.

- :1234: **Positioning:** Proper positioning of elements is essential for achieving the desired layout and visual appeal.

## :sunglasses: Cool JavaScript Tab Switching 

The JavaScript code snippet provided above demonstrates a straightforward way of creating switchable tab content. The code uses event listeners to handle tab clicks and then adds or removes classes to show or hide the corresponding tab content. Additionally, the use of ES6 template literals (`${this.id}-content`) to target the correct tab content is a neat technique.

## :construction: Features in Development 

The current version of the Netflix Clone only includes the homepage. In the future, the project might be expanded to include other pages from the Netflix website, giving it more functionality and completeness.
